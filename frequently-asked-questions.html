<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h2>What type of material do you use?</h2>
    <p>We use 10 gauge, 3/4" flat expanded carbon or stainless steel.  Carbon is good up to
    700&deg; and stainless can handle temperatures up to 1500&deg;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Should I get stainless?</h2>
    <p>You should get a stainless basket if you anticipate your smoker temperatures to get above
    700&deg;.  This is typically not possible in a run-of-the-mill consumer grade smoker.  Some larger
    smokers or modified smokers may reach higher temperatures.  Also, you may consider getting stainless
    if you plan on using it alot.  Stainless is a more durable material.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>How long until I receive my order?</h2>
    <p>We keep carbon 12&quot;x12&quot;x6&quot; baskets in stock and ship them out within a day or two.  Anything
    else may take a week or so to get shipped.  In general, please allow 2-3 weeks for delivery.</p>

    <h2>Why do you no longer offer a painting option?</h2>
    <p>We do not recommend painting your basket and have decided to no longer offer the option.  If you must
    have your basket painted you can pick up a can of 1200&deg; barbecue paint at Lowe's or Home Depot.</p>
